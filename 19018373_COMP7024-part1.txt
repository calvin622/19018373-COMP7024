Coursework- Part 1: Security of an OS- File System Security

high-level description of the security features of an OS file system

An operating system may implement many security features to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the file system. Each operating system may have its methods of protecting the file system, but they should all attempt to achieve the core security features detailed by S TANENBAUM, ANDREW Bos, Herbert (2015) in the book “Modern Operating Systems”.
The book goes into detail about how operating systems work, but the text can be dissected to reveal the importance of protecting the file system on a computer and the various mechanisms that can be used. These mechanisms can include Access controls, authentication, encryption, auditing, file permissions, and integrity checking.
Access control can be used to restrict or limit user's and programme's access to files. Operating systems can use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict read, write, and execute privileges. (Chapter 11, p.796)
Authentication is used to verify a user or process and prevent unauthorised access to a file system and is an essential security feature of modern operating systems. It requires a user to authenticate, either with something they know (passwords), something they have (security keys), or something they are (biometrics). (Chapter 9. P.729)
Encryption in a file system can transform data on a disk at rest or in transit to an unreadable form and protect the confidentiality of file systems. The two main methods of encryption include public key and private key. (Chapter 9, p.724)
Permissions are a type of access control that is commonly used by operating systems to determine who can use a file or directory and how. Permissions are often seen as flags and are separated between users, groups, and owners. (Chapter 10, p.932)
Integrity checkers can compute a checksum for each file within a file system. File tampering can be detected by comparing the file's original checksum with its new checksum at regular intervals. This is a popular method of anti-virus software which is sometimes built into modern operating systems. (Chapter 9, p.778)
How Microsoft Windows OS provides file system security

Access control has been seen in Microsoft Windows operating systems as far back as 1996 with the release of Windows NT 4.0 (Microsoft, 2021). It is still present in Microsoft Windows 10 and later. It is used after a user has authenticated to a system to determine the resources they have access to. Microsoft Windows uses ACLs to protect system objects, including files. Unique security identifiers (SIDs) are used to assign file permissions, including read, write, and execute to users and groups. The operating system completes an access control check to determine the SIDs for users and groups (Microsoft, 2023a).
Typical password authentication is only as secure as the user’s password, so other forms of authentication are necessary for better security. Released with Windows 10 in 2015, and still available within Windows 11, Microsoft gives the option to replace passwords with Windows Hello. Windows Hello is a biometric authentication system that enables users to sign in to their Windows systems without entering a password by scanning their face, fingerprint, or iris. Since it is more difficult to copy a user's biometric data than it is to guess or steal their password, this function adds a degree of security (Microsoft, 2023f).
Full hard drive encryption is provided within Windows 10 and 11, including newer versions of Windows servers from 2016. Full drive encryption is provided by Bitlocker, a Microsoft technology that automatically encrypts hard drives by using the cryptographic capabilities of the hardware. Bitlocker uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt data. Two keys are used for encryption and decryption, and they never leave the hard drive, preventing the risk of keys being misplaced or stolen (note these are not public and private keys as AES is symmetric). If the data encryption key (DEK) is modified or deleted, then all encrypted data will be lost. An authentication key (AK) is stored as a hash on the drive and is used to decrypt the DEK. The drive encryption is always on and every byte sent or received is encrypted using an encryption engine (Microsoft, 2023b).
Another encryption feature present within Windows 11 is personal data encryption (PDE). Releasing with version 22H2 in 2022 (Microsoft, 2023e), PDE works in addition to existing encryption techniques like BitLocker and encrypts specific files and content rather than entire volumes and discs. PDE reduces the number of passwords customers need to remember by connecting data encryption keys and user credentials with Windows Hello for Business. PDE can remove encryption keys when the device is locked and only releases data encryption keys when a user checks in using Windows Hello for Business (Microsoft, 2023c).
Modern Windows OS do not use checksums as a primary method to prevent file tampering as discussed in the book “Modern Operating Systems”. However, newer versions of Windows OS include a security feature called Controlled Folder Access (CFA). CFA was released with Windows 10 version 1709 and is still available in Windows 11. CFA allows administrators to define which folders on their system can be modified by trustworthy apps, which helps avoid file tampering. The OS Monitors the file system for modifications to protected folders and examines the actions of programmes that try to change those files (Microsoft, 2023d).
Comparison of Windows OS security features and Mac OS alternative

MacOS does include ACLs within their operating systems (Apple, 2019), however, they are outdated and no longer perform access control to standard files and directories as seen within Windows OS. The most similar feature to Windows’ ACLs is Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC has become very popular in macOS since the release of version 10.14 (Eskimo and Apple, 2023). The main functionality of MAC is to limit a program's access to files, folders, full disks, and data vaults. All processes within the operating are subject to MAC by default. Access to files can also be limited using user and group permissions, including permissions such as read & write, read-only, write-only, and no access (Apple, 2023a).
Touch ID is Apple’s implementation of fingerprint recognition, like Windows Hello. Touch ID was first implemented in 2016 in the release of macOS Sierra. It is a biometric feature that allows users to authenticate to their system without a password (Apple, 2023b). This protects the file system from common password attacks. Touch ID cannot be used to directly protect individual files and folders, however, it can be used with FileVault to provide similar results.
Like Windows, macOS also has a feature that can encrypt entire disks. FileVault was introduced by Apple in 2003 within macOS X 10.3 and is still present in the newest version of the OS. FileVault uses XTS-AES 128 encryption to encrypt the hard drive, which is a variant of AES that is used in Windows Bitlocker that has been modified to support Mac hardware architecture. The hardware encryption engine of FileVault decrypts the encryption key using the user's login password or recovery key. As the user accesses the data on the hard drive, the system utilises the encryption key to decrypt it (Apple, 2022b). This security feature can also encrypt singular files and folders, similar to Windows PDE, but in an all-in-one solution.
When it comes to ensuring file integrity of critical system files, macOS uses a feature called “System Integrity Protection” (SIP). SIP was introduced in macOS 10.11, and is very similar to CFA found in modern Windows operating systems. SIP works by preventing other users and processes from changing protected files and directories, such as system-level files, system binaries, and kernel extensions. It also restricts the permissions of the root user account. Attempts to change certain protected objects are prevented when SIP is enabled, and the user is alerted of the attempt (Apple, 2022a). The key difference between both implementations is that SIP applies to all system files and directories, whereas CFA Is user-defined.
