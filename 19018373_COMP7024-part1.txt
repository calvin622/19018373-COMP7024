Coursework- Part 1: Security of an OS- File System Security
An operating system may implement many security features to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the file system. Each operating system may have its methods of protecting the file system, but they should all attempt to achieve the core security features detailed by S TANENBAUM, ANDREW Bos, Herbert (2015) in the book “Modern Operating Systems”.
The book goes into detail about how operating systems work, but the text can be dissected to reveal the importance of protecting the file system on a computer and the various mechanisms that can be used. These mechanisms can include Access controls, authentication, encryption, auditing, file permissions, and integrity checking.
Access control can be used to restrict or limit user's and programme's access to files. Operating systems can use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict read, write, and execute privileges. (Chapter 11, p.796)
Authentication is used to verify a user or process and prevent unauthorised access to a file system and is an essential security feature of modern operating systems. It requires a user to authenticate, either with something they know (passwords), something they have (security keys), or something they are (biometrics). (Chapter 9. P.729)
Encryption in a file system can transform data on a disk at rest or in transit to an unreadable form and protect the confidentiality of file systems. The two main methods of encryption include public key and private key. (Chapter 9, p.724)
Permissions are a type of access control that is commonly used by operating systems to determine who can use a file or directory and how. Permissions are often seen as flags and are separated between users, groups, and owners. (Chapter 10, p.932)
Integrity checkers can compute a checksum for each file within a file system. File tampering can be detected by comparing the file's original checksum with its new checksum at regular intervals. This is a popular method of anti-virus software which is sometimes built into modern operating systems. (Chapter 9, p.778)
Access control has been seen in Microsoft Windows operating systems as far back as 1996 with the release of Windows NT 4.0 (Microsoft, 2021). It is still present in Microsoft Windows 10 and later. It is used after a user has authenticated to a system to determine the resources they have access to. Microsoft Windows uses ACLs to protect system objects, including files. Unique security identifiers (SIDs) are used to assign file permissions, including read, write, and execute to users and groups. The operating system completes an access control check to determine the SIDs for users and groups (Microsoft, 2023a).
Typical password authentication it is only as secure as the user’s password, and so other forms of authentication are necessary for better security. Releasing with Windows 10 in 2015, and still available within Windows 11, Microsoft gives the option to replace passwords with Windows Hello. Windows Hello is a biometric authentication system that enables users to sign in to their Windows systems without entering a password by scanning their face, fingerprint, or iris. Since it is more difficult to copy a user's biometric data than it is to guess or steal their password, this function adds an additional degree of security (Microsoft, 2023f).
Full hard drive encryption is provided within Windows 10 and 11, including newer versions of Windows servers from 2016. Full drive encryption is provided by Bitlocker, a Microsoft technology that automatically encrypts hard drives by using the cryptographic capabilities of the hardware. Two keys are used for encryption and decryption, and they never leave the hard drive, preventing the risk of keys being misplaced or stolen. If the data encryption key (DEK) is modified or deleted, then all encrypted data will be lost. An authentication key (AK) is stored as a hash on the drive and is used to decrypt the DEK. The drive encryption is always on and every byte sent or received is encrypted using an encryption engine (Microsoft, 2023b).
Another encryption feature present within Windows 11 is personal data encryption (PDE). Releasing with version 22H2 in 2022 (Microsoft, 2023e), PDE works in addition to existing encryption techniques like BitLocker and encrypts specific files and content rather than entire volumes and discs. PDE reduces the number of passwords customers need to remember by connecting data encryption keys and user credentials with Windows Hello for Business. PDE can remove encryption keys when the device is locked and only releases data encryption keys when a user checks in using Windows Hello for Business (Microsoft, 2023c).
Modern Windows operating systems do no use checksums as a primary method to prevent file tampering as discussed in in the book “Modern Operating Systems”. However, newer versions of Windows OS include a security feature called Controlled Folder Access (CFA). CFA was released with Windows 10 version 1709 and is still available in Windows 11. CFA allows administrators to define which folders on their system can be modified by trustworthy apps, which helps avoid file tampering. The OS Monitors the file system for modifications to protected folders and examining the actions of programmes that try to change those files (Microsoft, 2023d).
